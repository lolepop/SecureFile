removes last bytes for files and encrypts it, generating an encrypted file and the (original file - encrypted bytes).

niche thing that i use when i want to save a local backup on my computer and save space by uploading the large processed encrypted file onto the cloud.

good for high entropy data like encrypted archives and just provides security mostly by obscurity.

im too lazy to write a detailed and coherent readme file.
